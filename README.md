m.files of Optical Simulations of aberration

There are 11files in totoal.

test1.m&test2.m are almost the same, they simulate the behavior of double-spherical surface refraction of single convex.

test4.m simulates spherical aberrations with different ratio of R1/R2

test3.m simulates the behavior of double-spherical surface refraction of convex-concave union.

three_D_test.m simulates 3D situation of aberration 

spherical.m simulates single-spherical surface refraction with both concave and convex.

circle.m&ideal.m&drawing.m are all auxiliary functions of simulations.
